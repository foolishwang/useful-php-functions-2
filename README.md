Useful PHP Functions
====================

I've made this repository to store useful functions so I don't keep
rewriting them time after time.


Files:
------

* *linkify-text.php* - Turns links (and twitter names) into HTML links by surrounding with anchor tags.
* *truncate-with-ellipsis.php* - Truncates text to length provided and adds an ellipsis if necessary.
